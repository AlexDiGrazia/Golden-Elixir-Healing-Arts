<!-- Hi! Thanks for visiting the website and welcome to my private practice.  If youâ€™re here it is most likely because a friend recommended that I may be able to help.  What I do is help people get out of pain, regain mobility, and teach people how to heal themselves.  There is a lot that I do differently than your average, run-of-the-mill massage therapist, and so this website is dedicated to explaining my process, philosophy, and techniques.<br><br> -->
